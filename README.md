# copilot-review-playground

Playground repository to experiment with GitHub Copilot’s PR review behavior and our review templates. Keep changes small so review signals are easy to observe.

## How to use
1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b sample-change`.
2. Edit files under `.github` or this README to trigger Copilot review comments.
3. Open a PR and ask Copilot to review; check `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for expected reviewer rules.
